# Trivia-Game

An assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at UNC-Charlotte. Make a multiple choice trivia game based on click events to be played in the browser. Focuses on use of timers and intervals to run a repeating timer throughout the quiz. Emphasis was on using jQuery for the logic and dynamic display of various elements.

Big thanks to Howie Schwab, also known as "The Schwab", from the classic ESPN show "Stump the Schwab". One of my favorite shows to watch as a kid was his gameshow, so I immediately had inspiration for a trivia based game.
